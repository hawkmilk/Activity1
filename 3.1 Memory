## 2. Things I found Challenging

## 3. The Code
Car Class 
'''javascript
package package3;

public class Car {
    String brand;
    String name;
    int year;

    // Constructor For Car Brand, Model, and Year
    Car(String brand,String name, int year) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.name = name;
        this.year = year;
        //Using "this." To Connect the 2 Strings Even while In different Brackets.
    }

    // Code below will Print The
    void print() {
        System.out.println("Brand: "+ brand +", Model: " + name + ", Year: " + year);
    }


}
'''

MemDemo Class
'''javascript
package package3;

public class MemDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Object 1 allocated in Heap
        Car c1 = new Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2020);


        // Object 2 allocated in Heap
        Car c2 = new Car("Mazda", "RX7", 2015);


        // p1 is now pointing to a new object, the previous "Alice" object becomes unreachable
        c1 = new Car("Hyundai", "Accent", 2019);

        c1.print(); //Prints the Replacement Of c1
        c2.print();

        // Forced The Garbage Collection, Even though It's Automatic Most of the time
        System.gc(); //Deletes the First c1 (Toyota Camry)

        System.out.println("Garbage Collected");
    }

}
