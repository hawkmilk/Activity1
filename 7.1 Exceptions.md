## 2. What I Found Challenging
Originally Figuring Out the Best use For Exceptions Was What I was Mostly Confused about. But After Working with it hands on in this Assignment, It has started to give me New Ideas on how to impliment this into My Hangman Game Code.
## 4. The Code
### StepCounter Class
```
package sdccd;
import java.util.*;

public class StepCounter {
   
    //Method for the Steps to mile Converstion rate, Along with the Exception for Numbers below 0.
    public static double stepsToMiles(int steps) throws Exception {
        if (steps < 0) {
            throw new Exception("Exception: Negative step count entered.");
        }
        return steps / 2000.0;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scnr = new Scanner(System.in);

        while (true) {
            //a While Loop to Have Everything below Running Infinitely
            System.out.print("(Enter 0 to End) Insert Your Amount of Steps: ");
            int steps = scnr.nextInt();
            //Allows User to Type in Step Amount.

            if (steps == 0){
                System.out.println("Ending Program...");
                break;
                //An Option to End the Infinite Loop By Entering 0
            }

            try {
                double miles = stepsToMiles(steps);
                //Outputs the result as a Double, Allowing for Decimals
                System.out.printf("%.2f\n", miles); //%.#\n Adds the Wanted amount of Decimals
            } catch (Exception e) {
                //Catches Exception For Negative Numbers.
                System.out.println(e.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }
}
```
