# 5-6.1 _ Inheritance
## 1. Flow Chart

## 2. What I found Challenging:

## 3. Video
Sorry, But I'm Too lazy to make a video for all Assignments.
## 4.1: The First Part of the Code (Unmodified, From the Sample)
**Student Class**
```
package package6_1;

public class Student extends Person {
    private int idNum;

    public void setID(int studentId) {
        idNum = studentId;
    }

    public int getID() {
        return idNum;
    }
}
```
**Person Class**
```
package package6_1;

public class Person {
    private int ageYears;
    private String lastName;

    public void setName(String userName) {
        lastName  = userName;
    }

    public void setAge(int numYears) {
        ageYears = numYears;
    }

     // Other parts omitted
    public void printAll() {
        System.out.print("Name: " + lastName);
        System.out.print(", Age: "  + ageYears);
    }
}
```
### 4.2: The Updated Working Code (Main Method Only)
```
import package6_1.Student;

public class StudentDerivationFromPerson {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
       //Creates a New "Student" From the Constructor of Student Which Extends off Person.
        Student John = new Student();
        //For the Example, I'll Name the Variable John.

        John.setName("Smith");
        John.setID(9999);
        John.setAge(20);
        //Sets Up whatever will be in the Output by Using the Set Methods.

        John.printAll();
        System.out.print(", ID: "+John.getID());
        /*printAll Would Only Print Out Both the Name and The age, Leaving
        Only the ID Left, Which We Would Add Manually with Sys.Out.Print
        Along with the Already Made getID Method.*/
    }
}
```
